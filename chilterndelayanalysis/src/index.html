      <p>
        The baseline programme review provides our clients with an early
        appreciation of the acceptability and robustness of the contract
        programme. The baseline programme review is a process to review the
        proposed programme, focusing on whether it complies with the contractual
        requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will determine if the programme represents the ‘Works’ realistically
        and whether the planning and programming is deemed practical and
        complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide planning and programming specialists to review the merits of
        the baseline programme as a ‘statement of intent’ and to assess any risk
        associated with the baseline programme not being compliant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The baseline programme review process includes various tasks to ensure
        the programme complies with the contract requirements. These tasks
        involve a review of the proposed contract programme, a review of project
        documentation and follow-up actions, as necessary, to satisfy the
        project parties that the baseline programme is valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        The baseline programme review will use network-based techniques to
        identify the critical path(s) and assess whether the programme meets
        recognised good practice; e.g. identifying missing logic and
        highlighting the potential over-use of date constraints and excessive or
        forced float.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can also be used to review the proposed methodology used to measure
        contract performance and progress and to determine if processes and
        systems are structured to enable the accurate recording of progress and
        change.

          Dispute avoidance should be a fundamental objective of all parties
          involved in construction and engineering. Achieving this goal requires
          awareness, good communication and accurate record keeping. Potential
          disputes need to be identified, addressed and resolved at the earliest
          opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without such a strategy, the inevitable consequences are time
          consuming and expensive disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide bespoke solutions to suit individual business needs,
          implement systems and processes that provide a robust and measurable
          baseline programme which can then be used to accurately track the
          impact of change through the course of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dispute avoidance can be achieved by the early implementation of
          appropriate project controls and monitoring procedures, thus avoiding
          the considerable time, expense and inconvenience of preparing or
          defending claims in legal proceedings.

      <h2>Project Audit</h2>
      <div class="sectionText">
        <p>
          A project audit is an interim assessment of project progress in
          relation to an agreed baseline programme. An audit enables the early
          identification of programme delays and highlights the potential risks
          in respect of time to the successful delivery of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The audit will assess the criticality of delays and provide the
          opportunity to avoid formal disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide an independent peer review of project status as an
          alternative to the reported status prepared for clients by their
          project advisers and contractors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delay Analysis staff use the experience and forensic techniques gained
          from managing disputes to carry out accurate and efficient audits.
          Chiltern Delay Analysis will recommend strategies that, when
          implemented, will establish the necessary controls to produce high
          level reviews on a regular basis which often proves invaluable in
          avoiding disputes.
